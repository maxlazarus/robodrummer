This is a robot drummer with a PIC18 brain that I started working on a long time ago 

The drumming arm actuators are solenoids driven by high-current transistors and are activated to play 16-step sequences by the brain, which also controls a 5x16 RGB LED display and accepts input from buttons, switches, rotary controllers, and MIDI

Current tasks include
Software:
-review all code and edit for clarity
-improve MIDI input and output control
Hardware:
-design an enclosure
-review design of drumstick-holding mechanical and 3d-printed components
-integrate all power, microcontroller I/O, and display output into one circuit
